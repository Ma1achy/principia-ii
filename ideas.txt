If the user checks “Don’t warn me again”, I’d still allow the app to show the warning again automatically on clearly risky contexts (mobile / known weak GPU / WebGL/WebGPU fallback), or at least show a smaller non-blocking banner.
That avoids “I told it not to warn me and now it froze my laptop” moments.

> figure out max tile size can render (maybe underestimate to be conservative (so half tile size?)), then using current Resolution split into N tiles, then render from middle title outwards in a spiral

> BUG: with Chazy typing: sometimes doesn't fully finish typing then starts deleting (like doesn't let the text display just half writes then deletes when theres no interruption, this is most jarring when its a multiline sequence) or entire message just appears after half typing
> also i think the speeds etc still need more damping / guardrails as it can still goo too crazy, like chazy is supposed to be a more sort of calm etheral character
> also noticed that sometimes chazy doesn't say the next line in a multiline sequence and just goes to another random ambient line
