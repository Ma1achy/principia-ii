If the user checks “Don’t warn me again”, I’d still allow the app to show the warning again automatically on clearly risky contexts (mobile / known weak GPU / WebGL/WebGPU fallback), or at least show a smaller non-blocking banner.
That avoids “I told it not to warn me and now it froze my laptop” moments.
