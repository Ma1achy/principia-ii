# Build decisions ledger

A running log of decisions made while building the milestones autonomously —
anything where the code, the milestone doc, or a default had to be chosen or
corrected. Each entry: what was decided, why, and what it touched. Newest first.

The intent (per the build authorisation) is that every non-obvious choice is
flagged here so it can be reviewed rather than buried in a diff.

## M2 — Decoder atlas

Branch `feat/m2-decoder-atlas` off `webgpu-rewrite`. Acceptance gate
`npm test -- --run test/unit/decode test/golden/decode_landmarks` — **green on
first run** (21 tests: 1000-point encode/decode round-trip at 1e-9, 10000-point
totality, landmarks); full suite 77; typecheck/lint clean.

### D2.1 — `TerminalLabel` DEGENERATE reason: `string` → `number` (ADR-0007 alignment)
M0's `TerminalLabel` typed the DEGENERATE reason as `string`, but ADR-0007 (and
M2's `DegenerateReason` enum, codes 10–17) make it a closed numeric code shared
byte-for-byte with WGSL — and M2's pipeline passes the enum value. Changed the
base type in `src/math/types.ts` to `number` with a comment pointing at the
enum (not imported there, to keep `math` the base layer with no dependency on
`decode`). M0 doc listing updated to match. No existing producer of DEGENERATE
used a string.

### D2.2 — Doc listings cleaned for strict mode / lint (no semantic changes)
Unused type imports removed from the M2 doc's listings (`Triple` in
decode/types, `Vec3` in canonicalise, `TrajState` in no_holes, `Vec8` + the
whole unused `rotate.js` import in inverse); non-null assertions on loop-index
tuple reads in five test listings; the landmark test's `rhoT`/`lambdaT` typed
`as const` and its reconstructed `r` actually asserted on. All folded back into
`milestones/M2_decoder_atlas.md`; the committed code is semantically identical
to the doc.

### D2.3 — `no_holes.ts` stays out of the barrel (doc-faithful)
The doc's `index.ts` deliberately omits `no_holes.js` (its `safeguardDecode` is
an internal guard, first consumed in M3's dispatch path). Kept the barrel
exactly as the doc lists it rather than "completing" it.

## M1 — CPU reference integrator

Branch `feat/m1-cpu-integrator` off `webgpu-rewrite`. Acceptance gate
`npm test -- --run test/golden` — **green** (figure-8 strict golden + Burrau
physical validation); 16 unit integrate tests also green; typecheck/lint clean.

### D1.1 — Replaced the unachievable Burrau precision golden with a two-part golden (user-ratified)
The M1 doc gated on Burrau 3-4-5 reaching escape with `< 1e-7` energy drift.
Empirically (resolution sweep on the real integrator): `dt=1e-4` blows up at the
t≈16.5 encounter regardless of `NMax`; `dt=5e-5` completes (ESCAPE body 2,
t≈66.9) at 2e-2 drift; `dt=2.5e-5` gives a *different* escape time (t≈46) at
1.2e-1; `dt=1e-5` blows up. Not converged — the Pythagorean problem's deep
encounters need regularization the spec's per-macro-step adaptive substepping
doesn't have. Per the fixture policy (pin only trustworthy high-precision runs),
the golden was split: **(a)** figure-8 choreography as the strict 1e-7 pinned-
checkpoint golden (drift 8.5e-13 measured, checkpoints convergence-verified
1e-4 vs 2e-5 to <3e-6); **(b)** Burrau kept as physical validation asserting
only the robust Szebehely–Peters outcome (lightest body ejected) + drift/Lz
envelope; **(c)** new milestone `G19_close_encounter_regularization.md`
(Levi-Civita/KS) as the future home of a true Burrau precision golden.
Discussed with and approved by the user before implementing.

### D1.2 — Fixed a real MAX_SUBSTEPS bug: Yoshida sums vs the per-step cap
`run()` compared the macro step's substep count against `NMax`, but a Yoshida
step returns the *sum* over its constituent KDK steps (7 for Y6) — so a Y6 step
whose parts each used e.g. 60 substeps (< NMax=64) reported 420 and spuriously
terminated MAX_SUBSTEPS. Every step function now also returns `maxSub` (peak
per-constituent-KDK count); the saturation terminal and the `maxSubstepCount`
diagnostic key off it. Folded into the M1 doc listings.

### D1.3 — The doc's escaping body was wrong: body 2 (lightest), not body 1
The M1 doc asserted body 1 (mass 4/12) escapes. The literature (Szebehely &
Peters 1967) and both completed integrations agree it is the **lightest** body
— body 2, mass 3/12 — that is ejected, leaving the two heavier bodies as a
binary. The committed Burrau test asserts body 2. Doc corrected.

### D1.4 — Fixed a defective unit-test IC: equilateral-at-rest is a triple-collision orbit
The doc's Yoshida-vs-KDK drift comparison used three equal masses released from
rest at an equilateral triangle — a homothetic orbit that collapses to a
*triple collision* in finite time, so both integrators diverge (Y4 "drift" came
out 1343). Replaced with a smooth bound binary (same family the Y6-vs-Y4 test
already used). Both order-comparison tests now pass meaningfully. Doc updated
with a warning note.

### D1.5 — Strict-mode fixes in the doc's M1 source listings
`types.ts` re-exported `Force` alongside its own declaration (TS2484 conflict) —
removed from the re-export list. `run.ts:isFiniteState` indexed tuples by loop
variable (fails `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) — hoisted with non-null assertions.
Both folded into the doc.

## M0 — Foundations

Branch `feat/m0-foundations` off `webgpu-rewrite`. Acceptance gate
`npm test -- --run test/unit/math` — **green, 38 tests** (≥30 required);
`npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` also clean.

### D0.1 — Kept the existing richer `.gitignore` instead of the milestone's 5-line one
The M0 doc specifies a minimal `.gitignore` (`node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`,
`*.log`, `.DS_Store`). The repo already had a fuller, deliberately-authored
`.gitignore` (covers all of those plus `.claude/*` allow-listing, lockfiles,
editor cruft). Kept the existing one — it is a superset and the `.claude/`
handling is load-bearing for the skills/hooks. No functional gap versus the doc.

### D0.2 — Added a minimal `.eslintrc.cjs` (not in the M0 file tree)
`package.json` ships a `lint` script (`eslint src test --ext .ts`) and the
test/CI strategy's G8 unit job runs `lint → typecheck → test`, but the M0 file
tree lists no ESLint config, so `npm run lint` would error with "no config".
Added a minimal `.eslintrc.cjs` (`eslint:recommended` +
`@typescript-eslint/recommended`, `no-explicit-any` off for the tuple-cast math
primitives). Low-risk, unblocks the advertised script and the future CI job.

### D0.3 — Did **not** add a GitHub Actions workflow in M0
M0's Deliverable says "green CI gate," which could be read as a workflow file.
Per `docs/test-and-ci-strategy.md` ("M0 — config foundation … the *workflows*
arrive in G8"), M0 owns only the config that CI runs (`package.json` scripts +
`vitest.config`), and `.github/workflows/*` is a G8 deliverable. Kept M0 scoped
to config; the "gate" is the green `npm test`. Avoids duplicating/rewriting the
workflow in G8.

### D0.4 — Fixed two incorrect test **assertions** in the M0 doc (impls were correct)
The milestone's copy-paste tests failed against the correct implementations —
the assertions were wrong, not the code. Fixed in both the working tree and
`milestones/M0_foundations.md` (living-document discipline):

- **`sigmoid(-1000)` stability test.** Asserted `toBeGreaterThan(0)`, but
  `e^-1000 ≈ 5e-435` is below the smallest float64 subnormal, so `sigmoid`
  *correctly* saturates to exactly `0.0`. The real guarantee is finite / never
  NaN. Changed to `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` (kept the `< 1e-100` and
  `Number.isFinite` checks).
- **`smoothstep` endpoint-derivative test.** Asserted the forward-difference
  slope `< 1e-9`, but a forward difference of a function with zero first
  derivative and nonzero curvature is `O(eps) ≈ 3·eps ≈ 3e-6`, never `< 1e-9`.
  The `smoothstep` impl is the standard correct Hermite. Relaxed the threshold to
  `1e-4` (still ~5 orders below the interior slope `s'(0.5)=1.5`, so it genuinely
  tests "flat at the endpoints").

### D0.5 — Satisfied strict-mode lint/typecheck in the M0 doc's tests
Under the strict tsconfig (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) and ESLint, the doc's
verbatim tests didn't compile/lint clean. Fixed in tree + doc:

- Non-null assertions on in-range indexed reads in the numeric-loop assertions
  (`m2[i]!`, `m[i]!` in softmax; `lhs[i]!`, `rhs[i]!` in vec) — the indices are
  provably in bounds.
- Removed two unused imports (`scale2`, `dot3`) from `vec.test.ts`.

These are test-only edits; no production `src/math` code changed from the doc.
